### UO CIT Minor
The computer science department offers a Computer and Information Technology (CIT) minor, which emphasizes open-source technology and computing skills such as web development, networks, database programming and cloud computing. Read more about the CIT minor at cs.uoregon.edu.

### What the CIT Minor is About
From logical thought to programming, database concepts to website architecture, information privacy and security to networking and multimedia, the CIT minor is designed to help you understand how Information and Web technologies can be used to transform information in your own field of study.

The CIT minor uses open-source web technologies, networks, databases and cloud-computing to create, store, transmit and publish content on the world wide web, and cloud servers.

In the first year of the minor students learn IT concepts (such as networks, databases, and the WWW), and become skilled in using both basic and advanced web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, React, etc.).

In the second year of the minor, students study the following topics: database design, webDev frameworks, computer networks & cyber-security.
